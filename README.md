BornToWinBot
============

Welcome to the the repository. Let's make this bot win!

We will be focusing on making our Bot learn as discussed. We will also work on defence strategies.

Don't get confused with the dll folder, it contains the original UAlbertaBot.dll. The compiled dll will be located in the UAlbertaBot release folder.

Modifications so far:

1) 10 Zealots are built and then sent together to attack (first wave) (in CombatCommander.cpp)

2) Added custom build order: At frame 7500 (approximately after first wave) custom build starts to get executed - allot of     zealots and dragoons get built. (in ProductionManager.cpp) 

Priorities:

1) Worker rush.

2) Format custom build to strategy manager format.

3)  Make sure our workers don't all chase one unit (defend against rush).

4) Get learning working.
